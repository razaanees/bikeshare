Using an NN to predict the number of hourly rentals of a bike rental shop in San Francisco. The data and structure of the Jupyter notebook is provided
by Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree.

# Details
This project trains a neural network on hourly data collected over two years of a bike shop in San Francisco. The data includes several features such as the day, time of day, weather, etc. and labels the number of bikes rented for each entry. The neural network is trained on approximately 75% of the data which is used for training and validation. The entire analysis is completed in the _dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb_ Jupyter Notebook.
